make sure the styling for every subpage is the same, the overflow, the margins, the same labels etc. make sure with every new page coming, the style will be the same as the old ones
the "starting base" should be removed. "start depot" should be renamed to "starting base" and generate 1 iron/second, so basically i dont want to have both starting base and start depot on the map
scrolling is a must, this still does not work
deploy drones does not work, i was not able to test the "remove drones" button
the "ressources" panel on the map is too bug, it can be shrunk down
new settings page the be added the the navigation menu -> scientific, engineering and "normal" numbers, rename (the upper left name) for now, i will add more in the future
i dont want energy nodes on the map. energy will be collected with structure, that have to be built on empty tiles
i need a config page. best case scenario would be that i can log in to the game somehow and edit the files, or the gam detects that it is on dev and not on release and shows me the config page. on the config page, i want to be able to view, add, remove and edit entries for different parts of the game, for now, lets start with our drones, i want to be able to edit them. that also means we need a possibility to store the information somewhere that does not expose them to the user when i release the game to vercel or somewhere else later (or in general as a webgame), please give me some suggestions, for now json would be enough for me, but i am open for everything
make a structures, a research and a galaxy page, the order map - galaxy, crafting, drones, structures, research, settings - config
when clicking on an empty tile, i want to see the option to build structures (only available ones, some may be hidden behind progress, there will be a logic to which ones are available). for now, please make it possible to add a solar panel which generates 1 energy/second
the research tab will be disabled (with a "locked" sign behind it) and will be enabled later, as well as the galaxy tab
the hard reset button does not work
integrate tests for all functions, also for all future features and functions
